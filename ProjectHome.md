### Introduction ###

<img src='http://lh6.ggpht.com/_glRSY7BdJS4/TM5yhgvpgPI/AAAAAAAAAjo/bzyNGZoKEFU/s800/side.png' align='right' />Since you probably use one or more of [Mikrotik's routerboards](http://routerboard.com/) and their [RouterOS](http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/MikroTik_RouterOS) you, as a network administrator, would probably be interested at one point what web sites your network users visit. WebProxy Log can help you with that!

WebProxy Log package consist of WebProxy Log and WebProxy Log Catcher - intended to receive, import, store Mikrotik's web-proxy log data and finally, generate reports from those data. Both programs are unofficial (means not made by or supported by Mikrotik company), freeware and made to use with Windows (the newer the better ;).

### WebProxy Log Catcher ###

This module requires simple configuration and does the following:
Listens on a certain IP address/UDP port for log data which your pre-configured Mikrotik's logging environment is sending. Once WebProxy Log Catcher 'catches' the data, it writes that data to a file on your hard drive (to a log file).

### WebProxy Log ###

WebProxy Log is a primary program which imports log files from the import location to it's local database and can generate: surf logs (certain surfer's Internet traffic report between two dates), top 10 visited servers pie chart, top 10 surfers pie chart and the 'Who visited' report (which users visited certain server for how many times).
