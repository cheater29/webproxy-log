### About ###
Since you don't want in your report to see IP addresses as users, you can open IP alias configuration (menu 'Settings/IP aliases') and attach there an alias to a certain IP address. Reports will then show names instead of IP addresses.

IP addresses are automatically added to this list when importing a log file, or manually added with the '+' button. Removing an alias is easy; select a field containing an IP address or alias and click '-' button.

You can export IP aliases list to a [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file by clicking 'Export', and import the same CSV file by clicking 'Import'.

'Frob DB' button searches your database for missing IP addresses that are not in the list and adds if any is found.

Whether or not you make any changes, if you don't click 'Apply' button, when closing the IP aliases dialog, no changes will be made.
